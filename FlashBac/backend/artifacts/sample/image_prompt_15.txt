Create a realistic black and white historical photograph capturing a bustling street scene in Paris, circa 1946. The image should depict the aftermath of World War II, with visible signs of reconstruction and a sense of resilience among the people. Include period-appropriate details such as vintage automobiles, bicycles, and pedestrians dressed in 1940s attire. The street should be lined with buildings showing signs of war damage, with scaffolding and repair work in progress. The overall atmosphere should be one of determination and hope, reflecting the spirit of post-war France.
