Une scène de la guerre de Sécession, avec un soldat de l'Union et un soldat de la Confédération en train de se battre à l'épée. 1863.

Create a realistic black and white historical photograph of a dramatic scene from the American Civil War in 1863. Two soldiers, one from the Union Army and one from the Confederate Army, are engaged in a fierce sword fight. The soldiers are dressed in authentic period uniforms, with the Union soldier wearing a distinctive blue coat and the Confederate soldier in a gray coat. The background should feature a smoky battlefield with distant cannons and tents, capturing the chaos and intensity of the war. The image should be framed in a documentary style, with a focus on the raw and gritty reality of combat.
