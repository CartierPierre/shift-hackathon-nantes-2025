Create a realistic black and white historical photograph of a bustling street scene in a European city, circa 1946. The image should capture the post-war atmosphere with visible signs of reconstruction, such as crumbling buildings, scaffolding, and workers repairing infrastructure. Include period-appropriate details like vintage cars, trams, and pedestrians dressed in 1940s clothing. The scene should be framed in a documentary style, with a focus on the everyday life and resilience of the people in the aftermath of World War II.
