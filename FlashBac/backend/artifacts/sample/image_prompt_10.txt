Create a realistic black and white historical photograph of a bustling street market in Paris, circa 1946. The scene should capture the post-war atmosphere with vendors selling goods from makeshift stalls, and people dressed in period-appropriate clothing. Include elements such as crates of produce, handwritten signs, and a few bicycles parked nearby. The image should be framed in a documentary style, with a focus on the everyday life and resilience of the people in the immediate aftermath of World War II.
