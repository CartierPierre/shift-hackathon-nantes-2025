Create a realistic black and white historical photograph of a bustling city street in 1946. The scene should capture the atmosphere of post-war reconstruction, with visible signs of rebuilding and repair. Include elements such as crumbling buildings, scaffolding, and workers in period-appropriate attire. The street should be filled with people going about their daily lives, with cars and trams from the era adding to the authenticity. The image should be framed in a documentary style, capturing the resilience and determination of the people in the aftermath of World War II.
